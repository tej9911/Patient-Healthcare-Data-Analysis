# 🏥 Patient Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project utilizes a **Keras-based Machine Learning model** to analyze patient data and predict their **health condition and severity level**. By processing various health metrics such as **age, blood pressure, and blood test results**, the model provides insights into a patient's health status and offers suggestions for improvement.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Predicts blood count values** using a trained ML model
- 📊 **Analyzes health condition** based on test results
- ⚠️ **Generates severity level** to indicate potential health concerns
- 💡 **Provides suggestions** for maintaining a healthy lifestyle
- 🖥️ **User-friendly interface** built with Streamlit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 🔬 Keras & TensorFlow
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy
- 🎨 Streamlit (for UI)
